## Linux Support
Yes you heard that right. You can have clippy in Linux.

However, there is no uniform system tray in Linux. So in Linux you will only be able to do one clip each time you run this program.

### Linux installation
There are no binaries provided for Linux.

* Tested with python 3.11, but other versions should work.
* For pyqt6 you will need libxcb-cursor0. So on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0`.
* `pip install pyqt6 pyperclip`.
* `python aisnip.py` when you are ready to go clipping.
